# Hacking

SH-wg is [open hardware](https://github.com/hatlabs/SH-wg-hardware) and [open software](https://github.com/hatlabs/SH-wg-firmware).
You can customize the device software and even hardware to suit your needs.
Programming pads are available on the top of the device for easy access to the microcontroller.
Use an [ESP-Prog](https://espressif-docs.readthedocs-hosted.com/projects/espressif-esp-iot-solution/en/latest/hw-reference/ESP-Prog_guide.html) board or other suitable programmer to program the microcontroller.
For other use cases, JTAG pads and pads for 9 other GPIO pins are exposed on the main board for customization purposes.

We encourage you to share your customizations with other users on the [Hat Labs discussion group](https://github.com/hatlabs/discussions/discussions/)!

Note that we are unable to provide individual support for software or hardware modifications, and any damage caused by such modifications is not covered by the warranty.
